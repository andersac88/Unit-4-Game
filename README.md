# Unit-4-Game


When the page loads, the user will see a page with five circlular images and a target number which is between 19 and 120.

Each of the circular images has been assigned a random value, between 1 and 12.

When clicked, the assigned value of the image will be added to the current total, which starts at 0.

The goal is to have the current total equal the target number by clicking the various images. If you overshoot the target number, you loose. 

This project provides a great introduction to jquery and combines this knowledge with both HTML and CSS.
